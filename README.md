Loan Default Analysis – Power BI Project

- Problem Statement

Financial institutions face increasing challenges in managing credit risk, especially when it comes to predicting loan defaults. Despite access to large volumes of applicant data, many lenders struggle to identify key risk indicators early in the application cycle. This leads to higher default rates, loss of revenue, and weakened portfolio performance. The absence of intuitive, visual tools to explore and analyze borrower data often results in missed insights and reactive—not proactive—decision-making.

- Solution Approach

This Power BI project addresses the problem by transforming complex loan and applicant datasets into an interactive, insight-rich reporting tool. It empowers users to:

Visualize default trends at a glance through clean, dynamic charts and KPIs.

Explore applicant demographics and financial behavior with cross-filtered visuals.

Compare key financial metrics of defaulters and non-defaulters to spot early warning signals.

Identify high-risk segments using layered data storytelling and drilldowns.

By combining data modeling with thoughtful visual design, the project turns raw numbers into actionable insights, supporting faster and more informed lending decisions

- What Makes It Stand Out

Clean, modern visuals designed for clarity and depth.

Interactive filters that allow users to explore data across dimensions.

Smart use of KPIs, trend charts, and segmentation visuals to reveal hidden patterns.

A narrative flow that walks viewers from high-level patterns to deep-dive metrics.

- Tools & Techniques

Power BI: Visualization, DAX measures, calculated columns

Data Source: Excel datasets (or connected database)

Data Prep: Cleaning, transformation, and modeling inside Power BI

- Use Case
  
Ideal for financial analysts, credit risk teams, or data-driven decision makers, this dashboard provides an at-a-glance understanding of default risks and how they connect with borrower attributes and financial health.

- Conclusion
  
This project blends storytelling with analytics, turning raw loan data into meaningful insights. Whether you're scanning high-level trends or exploring applicant-level factors, the dashboard is built to empower smarter lending strategies.
